From the navbar at the top, a user can view the contact page by clicking on the
'About Us' link.

The page will contain the same navbar as the home page, and also the logo.

There will be 5 photos beneath this, each with an image of the five of us and a brief
description beneath the five photos talking about our backgrounds.

Beneath this there will be an image of a map of where our shop is and a link to google
maps beneath it. There will be a short paragraph detailing the history of our shop.
