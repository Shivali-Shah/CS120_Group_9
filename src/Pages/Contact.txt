From the navbar at the top, a user can view the contact page by clicking on the
contact link.

The page will contain the same navbar as the home page, and also the logo.

On the left hand side of the page will be a "Get in touch" section with basic contact
details such as a phone number and email address. There will also be an address
where we are based.

There will be a paragraph detailing why you should get in contact with us, explaining
that no matter the occasion (fashion photoshoot, wedding, etc) that we have the skills
and passion to deliver exactly what they're looking for.

There will be a short note detailing the areas that we cover (Glasgow, Edinburgh, Perth,
Dundee).

On the right hand side of the page there will be a contact form. The form will have many
fields with textboxes where a user can enter in their information. This would be a name
box, email address, tel number, requested date for shoot, the package that they're
interested in, and a message for any extra details. At the bottom will also be a
captcha to deter spam and bot attacks. After that, the user can submit the form.
