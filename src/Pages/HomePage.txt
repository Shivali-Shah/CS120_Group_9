The home page will be the landing page when you enter the website

The page will contain our logo and website name at the top left

Underneath this, there will be a navbar which contains all of the links to take the
user to the various areas of the website. This will be Home, Portfolio/Gallery,
Client access (where a logged in user can receive their photo package uploads),
About us, Packages, and Contact.

Further down the page, there will be a few example photos from previous shoots
accompanied by a short description of what we do and where we are based.

There will be a paragraph which details why we do this, why we are passionate about it.
